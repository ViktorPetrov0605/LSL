# Project Status Update

## Branching and Task Organization

I've organized the project task tracking and created feature branches for different components:

1. **Feature branches**:
   - `feature/client-config-uuid`: Client UUID/token generation (Task 2.1.1)
   - `feature/client-sync`: Config fetching and syncing (Task 2.1.2)
   - `feature/client-ping`: Background ping thread (Task 2.2.1)
   - `feature/client-containers`: Container management (Tasks 2.4.2, 2.4.3)
   - `feature/web-admin-ui`: (In progress) Web admin UI (Task 1.3.1)
   - `feature/project-structure`: Project organization with todo/done tracking
   - `backlog`: Remaining project files

2. **Task tracking**:
   - Updated `todo/README.md` with remaining tasks
   - Updated `done/README.md` with completed tasks and branch information
   - Created `NEXT_SPRINT.md` with planning for the next iteration

## Testing

All implemented components have corresponding test files in the `tests/` directory, following test-driven development practices.

## How to Continue

To continue development:
1. Pull the repository
2. Check out the feature branch you want to work on
3. Implement the remaining tasks in that branch
4. Write tests before implementing features
5. Commit and push changes to the feature branch
6. Create a pull request when the feature is complete
