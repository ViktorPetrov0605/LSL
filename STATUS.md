# Project Status Update

## Branching and Task Organization

I have organized the project task tracking and created feature branches for different components:

1. **Feature branches**:
   - `feature/client-config-uuid`: Client UUID/token generation (Task 2.1.1)
   - `feature/client-sync`: Config fetching and syncing (Task 2.1.2)
   - `feature/client-ping`: Background ping thread (Task 2.2.1)
   - `feature/client-containers`: Container management (Tasks 2.4.2, 2.4.3)
   - `feature/web-admin-ui`: (In progress) Web admin UI (Task 1.3.1)
   - `feature/project-structure`: Project organization with todo/done tracking
   - `backlog`: Remaining project files

2. **Task tracking**:
   - Updated `todo/README.md` with remaining tasks
   - Updated `done/README.md` with completed tasks and branch information
   - Created `NEXT_SPRINT.md` with planning for the next iteration

## Next Steps

See `NEXT_SPRINT.md` for detailed planning of the next iteration, which includes:
- Completing Web Admin UI Authentication
- Implementing User Management in Web Admin UI
- Container Management in Web Admin UI
- Multi-User Session Integration
- Client-Side Logging
