This file defines the container mappings used by your `lsl.py` script. You can:
1. Add your own Docker repositories
2. Uncomment existing examples
3. Use `python lsl.py -l` to list configured containers

The format requires:
- No leading/trailing spaces around `=`
- One container per line
- Comments start with `#`

Would you like to add any specific containers or modify this format?
